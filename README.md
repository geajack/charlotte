**Charlotte** is a minimalist blogging platform written in Python using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). The platform targets people who just want a personal space in which to post text online.

The design philosophy behind Charlotte is supported on three main pillars:

- Minimalist feature set. Just a bunch of text files on the internet.
- Post and manage articles using a simple HTTP API, rather than a built-in web editor. You can write your content however and wherever you want.
- Extending and customizing Charlotte is easy as long as you know how to program. No frustrating hours reading plugin development documentation, no 1500 line HTML templates.
