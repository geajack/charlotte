The lifecycle of the frog is divided into three stages:

1. First there is the egg, or "spherical" stage. At this point the frog resembles a small grape.
2. Then there is the tadpole or "no legs" stage. Now the frog can swim.
3. Finally there is the "frog" stage. Now the frog grows legs and can hop and croak.
